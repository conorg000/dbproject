# dbproject
A group project from Database Management uni subject

In a team of two, we were given information about a hypothetical airline start-up and their database needs. After some brainstorming, we designed a pretty ERD. Then we used SQL to set up the database, enter company data, and finally, perform a few queries to test it all out.
